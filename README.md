# Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?


In this project, I have analysed and predicted loan approval status based on multiple variables based on dataset I found on kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied)). Initially, I pre-processed this dataset, selecting and modifying parameters that I chose. Further model training was performed into predicting the best result for the loan approval. Among other things, I used KNN, logistic regression, Linear SVM, XGBoost classifiers.

    
    Note: this project is still in development
